# Backend Execution Patterns
How Backends accept, dispatch and execute requests.

## What is a Process?
- A set of instructions
- Has an isolated memory
- Has a PID (Process Identifier)
- Scheduled in the CPU

## What is a Thread?
- It's a LWP (lightweight process)
- A set of instructions
- Shares memory with parent process
- Has a ID

## What is a Single Threaded Process?
- One Process with a single Thread
- Simple
- Example NodeJS

## What is a Multi-Processes?
- App has multiple processes
- Each has its own memory
- Examples NGINX/Postgres
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- More memory but isolated
- Redis backup routine (COW)

## What is a Multi-Threaded?
- One Process, multi threads
- Shared Memory (compete)
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- Require less memory
- Race conditions
- Locks and Latches (SQL Server)
- Examples Apache, Envoy

## What is different Process vs Thread?
Process is an instance of a program that is being executed by the operating system, while a thread is a flow of execution within a process.
