# Backend Execution Patterns
How Backends accept, dispatch and execute requests.

## What is a Process?
- A set of instructions
- Has an isolated memory
- Has a PID (Process Identifier)
- Scheduled in the CPU

## What is a Thread?
- It's a LWP (lightweight process)
- A set of instructions
- Shares memory with parent process
- Has a ID

## What is a Single Threaded Process?
- One Process with a single Thread
- Simple
- Example NodeJS

## What is a Multi-Processes?
- App has multiple processes
- Each has its own memory
- Examples NGINX/Postgres
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- More memory but isolated
- Redis backup routine (COW)

## What is a Multi-Threaded?
- One Process, multi threads
- Shared Memory (compete)
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- Require less memory
- Race conditions
- Locks and Latches (SQL Server)
- Examples Apache, Envoy

## What is different Process vs Thread?
Process is an instance of a program that is being executed by the operating system, while a thread is a flow of execution within a process.

## How Connections are Established
- TCP Three way handshake (SYNC, SYNC-ACK, ACK)
- In the Backend:
    - Server Listens on an address:port
    - Client Connections
    - Kernel does the handshake creating a connection:
        - Kernel creates a socket & two queues SYN and Accpet
        - Client sends a SYN
        - Kernels adds to SYN queue, replies with SYN/ACK
        - Client replies with ACK
        - Kernel finish the connection
        - Kernel removes SYN from SYN queue
        - Kernel adds full connection to Accept queue
    - Backend process "Accepts" the connection:
        - Backend accepts a connection, remove from accept queue
        - A file descriptor is created for the connection

## How Reading and Send Connection data
- Send and receive buffers:
    - Client sends data on a connection
    - Kernels puts data in receive queue
    - Kernel ACKs (may delay) and update window
    - App calls read to copy data

## What is idempotency?
- Idempotent request can be retried without affecting Backend
- Easy implementation send a requestId
- If requestId has been processed return
- Also knwon as idempotency token

## What is Nagle's algotrithm
- Delay in the client side to server side
- In te telnet days sending a single byte in a segment is a waste
- Combine small segments and send them in a single one
- The clinet can wait for a full MSS before sending the segment
- No wasted 40 bytes header (IP + TCP) for ffew bytes of data

### Problem with Nagle's algotrithm
- Sending large data causes delay
- A want to send 5000 bytes on 1460 MSS
- 3 full segments of 1460 MSS with 630 bytes
- 4th segment is not sent!
- 4th not full segment are only sent when an ACK is received

## My Own Note
1. What is connection OS, Kernels, Process and Thread?
    - Kernel is the core component of an OS, that manage hardware resource essential services to applications and other parts of the OS
    - So, inside of OS has Kernel and Kernel has Process then in Process has Thread
