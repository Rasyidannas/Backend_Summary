# What is a Proxy?
Proxy is it's a server that makes requests on your behalf or acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet.

## Proxy use cases or functions
- **Caching or Imporoved performance:** Proxies can cahce frequently accessed web pages, reducing load times and bandwith usage
- **Anonymity and Privacy:** By masking the user's IP address, a proxy can help maintainprivacy and anonymity online
- **Blocking Sites or Access control:** Proxies can restrict access to certain websites or content, often used in workplaces or schools. 
- **Logging or Bypassing Restrictions:** They allow users to access geo-restricted or blocked content by routing traffic thourgh servers in deifferent functions.
- **Microservices**
- **Content Filtering:** They can block specific content, such as ads or malicious sites.

## Type of Proxies:
- **Forward Proxy:** Sits between the client and the internet, commonly used for internal networks.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Sits between the internet and a web servers, often used for load balancing and security.
- **Transparent Proxy:** Intercepts traffic without modifying request, often used for caching or filtering.
- **Anonymous Proxy:** Hides the user's IP address but identifies itsef as a proxy.
- **High Anonymity Proxy:** Completely hides the user's IP address and does not reveal itself as a proxy.

## What is Reverse Proxy?
A reverse proxy is a server that sits between the internet and a web server (or multiple servers). It acts as an intermediary, receiving client requests, forwarding them to the appropriate backend server, and then returning the server's response to the client. *Unlike a forward proxy, which protects clients, a reverse proxy protects and optimizes the backend servers.*

### Key Functions of a Reverse Proxy:
- Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
- Security: Hides the identity and details of backend servers, protecting them from direct exposure to the internet.
- Caching: Stores static content to reduce server load and improve response times.
- SSL Termination: Handles encryption/decryption, offloading this task from backend servers.
- Compression: Compresses data to improve performance.
- Routing: Directs requests to the appropriate backend server based on the request type or content.
