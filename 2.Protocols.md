# What is Protocol?

- A system that allows two parties to communicate
- A protocol is designed with a set of properties
- Depending on the purpose of the protocol
- TCP, UDP, HTTP, gRPC, FTP

## Protocl propertis

1. Data format
   - Text based (plain text, JSON, XML)
   - Binary (protobuf, RESP, h2/HTTP2, h3/HTTP3)
2. Transfer mode
   - Message based (UDP, HTTP)
   - Stream (TCP, WebRTC)
3. Addressing system
   - DNS name, IP, MAC
4. Directionality
   - Bidirectional (TCP)
   - Unidirectional (HTTP)
   - Full/Half duplex
5. State
   - Stateful (TCP, gRPC, apache thrift)
   - Stateless (UDP, HTTP)
6. Routing
   - Proxies, Gateways
7. Flow & Congestion control
   - TCP (Flow & Congestion)
   - UDP (No control)

## OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement standard protocols in network communications.

### Why do we need a communication model?

1. Agnostic applications
   - Without a standard model, your apllication must have knowledge of the underlying network medium
   - Imagine if you have to author different version of your apps so that it works on wifi vs ethernet vs LTE vs fiber
2. Network Equipment Management
   - Without a standard model, upgrading network equipment becomes difficult
3. Decoupled Innovation
   - Innovations can be done in each layer separetly without affecting the rest of the models

### What is the OSI Model?

1. Layer 7 - Application - HTTP/FTP/gRPC
   - Example - sender: POST request with JSON data to HTTPS server (start from this)
   - Example - receiver: Application understands the JSON POST request and your express json or apache request recieve event is triggered
2. Layer 6 - Presentation - Encoding, Serialization
   - Example - sender: Serialize JSON to flat byte strings
   - Example - receiver: Deserialize flat byte strings to JSON for the app to consume
3. Layer 5 - Session - Connection establishment, TLS
   - Example - sender: Request to establish TCP connection/TLS
   - Example - receiver: The connection session is established or identified, We only arrive at this layer when necessary (3 way handshake is done)
4. Layer 4 - Transport - UDP/TCP
   - Example - sender: Sends SYN request target port 443
   - Example - receiver: The IP packets from layer 3 are assembled into TCP segments, Deal with congestion control/flow control/retransmission in case of TCP, If segment is SYN  we don't need to go further into more layers as we are still processing the connection request
5. Layer 3 - Network - IP
   - Example - sender: SYN is placed an IP packet(s) and adds the source/dest IPs
   - Example - reciever: The frames from layer 2 are assembled into IP packet
6. Layer 2 - Data Link - Frames, Mac address Ethernet
   - Example - sender: Each packet goes into a single frame and adds the source/dest MAC addresses
   - Example - receiver: The bits from Layer 1 assembled into frames
7. Layer 1 - Physical - Electric Signals, fiber or radio waves
   - Example - sender: Each frame becomes string of bots which converted into either a radio signal (wi-fi), electrical signal (ethernet), or light (fiber).
   - Example - reciever: Radio, electric or light is received abd converted into digitals bits (start from this)

## IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers separated by periods or colons that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network

- Layer 3 property in OSI model
- Can be set automatically or statically
- Netwokr and Host portion
- 4 bytes in IPv4 - 32 bits

### Network vs Host

**Network Portion:** This part of the IP address identifies the specific network the device belongs to. It's used to route traffic to the correct network.
**Host Portion:** This part of the IP address identifies the specific device within that network. It's used to deliver traffic to the right device on the network

- a.b.c.d/x (a.b.c.d are integers) x is the network bits and remains are host (subnet mask)
- Example 192.168.254.0/24
- The first 24 bits (3 bytes) are network the rest 8 are for host
- This mean we can have 2^24 (1677216) networks and each networj has 2^8 (255) hists
- Also called a subnet

### Subnet

A subnet, short for "subnetwork", is a logical subdivision of an IP network. Think of it like dividing a large neighborhood into smaller blocks.

- 192.168.254.0/24 is also called a subnet
- The subnet has a mask 255.255.255.0
- Subnet mask is used to determined whether an IP is in the same subnet

### IP Packet

Think of an IP packet as an envelope carrying data across the internet. It's the fundamental unit of information that gets passed around between computers on a network.

- The IP Packet has headers and data sectios
- IP Packet header is 20 bytes (can go up to 60 bytes if options are enavled)
- Data section can go up to 65536

### ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It's a core protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite, primarily used for sending error messages and operational information about IP network conditions.

- Stands for Internet Control Message Protocol
- Designed for information messages
  * Host unreachable, port unreachable, fragmentation needed
  * Packet expired (infinite loop in routers)
- Uses Ip directly
- PING and tracerouts use it
- Doesn't require listeners or ports to be opened
- Some firewalls block ICMP for security reasons
- That is whay PING might not work in those cases
- Disabling ICMP also can cause real demage with connection establishment
  * Fragmentation needed
- PING demo

## UDP (User Diagram Protocol)

It is a layer 4 protocol that provides a simple and connectionless way to send and receive data over a network.

- Stands for User Diagram Protocol
- Layer 4 protocol in OSI model
- Ability to address processes in a host using ports
- Simple protocol to send and recieve data
- Prior communication not required (double edge sword)
- Stateless no knowledge is stored on the host
- 8 byte header Datagram
- **Anatomy UDP:**
  * UDP Header is 8 bytes only (IPv4)
  * Datagram slides into an IP packet as "data"
  * Port are 16 bit (0 to 65535)

### UDP Use Cases

- Video streaming
- VPN
- DNS
- WebRTC

### UDP Pros and Cons

#### Pros

- Simple protocol
- Header size is small so datgrams are small
- Uses less badwith
- Stateless
- Consumes less memory (no state stored in the server/client)
- Low latency - no handshake, order, retransmission or guaranteed delivery

#### Cons

- No acknowledgement
- No guarantee delivery
- Connection-less - anyone can send data without prior knowledge
- No flow control
- No congestion control
- No ordered packets
- Security - can be easily spoofed


## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

It is a layer 4 protocol that provides a reliable, connection-oriented way to send and receive data over a network.

- Stands for Transmition Control Protocol
- Layer 4 protocol in OSI model
- Ability to address proesses in a host using ports
- "Controls" the transmission unlike UDP which is a firehose
- Connection
- Requires handshake
- 20 bytes header Segment (can go to 60)
- Stateful

### TCP Use Cases

- Reliable communication
- Remote shell
- Databse connections 
- Web communications
- Any bidirectional communication

### TCP Segment
- TCP segment Header is 20 bytes and can go up to 60 bytes
- TCP segments slides into and IP packetas "data"
- Port are 16 bit (0 to 65535)
- Sequences, Acknowledgement, flow control and more

### TCP Connection
- Connection is a Layer 5 (session)
- Connection is an agreement between client and server
- Must create a connection to send data
- Connection is identified by 4 properties
   * SourceIP-SourcePort
   * DestinationIP-DestinationPort
   * SequenceNumber
   * AcknowledgmentNumber
- Can't send data outside of a connection
- Sometimes called socket or file descriptor
- Requires a 3-way TCP handshake
- Segments are sequenced and ordered
- Segment are acknowledged
- Lost segments are retransmitted

## TLS (Transport Layer Security)
TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. It's a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. In simpler terms, it's like a secret code language for your computer to talk to other computers safely, especially when sensitive information like passwords or credit card details are involved.

### How TLS works
1. Handshake: Before any data is exchanged, the client (your computer) and the server (the website you're visiting) perform a "handshake." This is like a secret knock to verify each other's identity and agree on the encryption methods they'll use.

2. Encryption: Once the handshake is complete, all data sent between the client and server is encrypted. This means it's scrambled into a code that only the intended recipient can decipher, protecting it from prying eyes.

3. Data Integrity: TLS also ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with during transmission. It adds special codes to the messages that act like digital signatures, so any changes would be immediately detected.

### Why TLS
- We encrypt with symmetric key algorithms
- We need to exchange the symmettric key
- Key exchange uses asymmetric key (PKI)
- Authenticate the server
- Extension (SNI, preshared, 0RTT)

## HTTP
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Think of it as the language that web browsers and servers use to talk to each other.   

### All about HTTP:
1. Request-Response Cycle
   - Client initates: A client (like your web browser) sends a request to a server (where the website is hosted) in browser, python aor javascript app or any app.
   - Server Responds: The server processes the request and sends back a response from HTTP server (Apache Tomcat, NodeJS, etc) to the client.
   - Content Delivery: This response usually contains the requested resource (like a webpage, image, or video).
2. Stateless Protocol
   - No Memory: HTTP doesn't remember past interactions. Each request and response is treated independently.
   - Implications: This makes HTTP simple and scalable, but it also means that additional mechanisms (like cookies or sessions) are needed to maintain state across multiple requests.
3. Components of an HTTP Request
   - Method: Indicates the action to be performed (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - URL (Uniform Resource Identifier): Specifies the address of the resource
   - Headers: Provide additional information about the request (e.g., browser type, accepted content types).
   - Body (optional): Contains data to be sent to the server (e.g., form data).
4. Components of an HTTP Response
   - Status Code: Indicates the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
   - Headers: Provide information about the response (e.g., content type, length).
   - Body: Contains the actual data being sent back (e.g., the HTML of a webpage)

### HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 is a revision of the original HTTP (HTTP/1.0) and is a widely used protocol for communication on the World Wide Web.  
Example of HTTP/1.1 Request:
```bash
   curl -v http://example.com/about
```
```bash
   GET /about HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   User-Agent: curl/7.79.1
   Accept: */*
```
#### Key Features and Improvements
- Persisted TCP Connection
- Low Latency & Low CPU Usage
- Streaming with Chunked transfer
- Pipelining (disable by default)
- Proxying & Multi-homed websites

### HTTP/2
HTTP/2.0 is a major revision of the HTTP protocol, designed to address some of the performance limitations of HTTP/1.1. It was published in 2015 and has since been widely adopted by web servers and browsers.

#### HTTP/2 Pros
- Multiplexing over Single Connection (save resources)
- Compression (Headers & Data)
- Server Push
- Secure by default
- Protocol Negotiation during TLS (ALP)

#### HTTP/2 Cons
- TCP head of line blocking 
- Server Push never picked up
- High CPU usage

## WebSocket
WebSockets are a communication protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This means that both the client and server can send messages to each other concurrently, enabling real-time interaction.

### Key Features: 
- Bi-directional Communication
- Real-time Applications
- Low Overhead
- Wide Support

### How WebSocket Works:
- **Handshake**: The client initiates a WebSocket connection by sending an HTTP upgrade request to the server.
- **Upgrade**: If the server supports WebSockets, it accepts the request and upgrades the connection from HTTP to WebSocket.
- **Data Exchange**: Once established, both client and server can send and receive messages in the form of text or binary data.
- **Closing**: Either party can close the connection gracefully.

### WebSocket Use Cases:
- Chatting
- Live Feed
- Multiplayer gamming
- Showing client progress/logging

### WebSocket Pros and Cons 
- **Pros:**
   1. Full-duplex (no polling)
   2. HTTP compatible
   3. Firewall friendly (standard)

- **Cons:**
   1. Proxying is tricky
   2. L7 LB challenging (timeouts)
   3. Statefull, difficult to horizontal scale
