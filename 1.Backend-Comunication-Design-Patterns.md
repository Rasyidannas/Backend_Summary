# Backend Communication Design Patterns

## Request - Response

This is classic, simple, and everywhere.

### What happens in the Request Response Model

1. `Client sends a Request`
2. `Server parses the Request`
3. `Server processes the Request`
4. `Server sends a Response`
5. `Client parses the Response and consumes`

### Where this is used in:

1. Web, HTTP, DNS, SSH
2. RPC (remote procedure call)
3. SQL and Database Protocols
4. APIs (REST/SOP/GraphQL)
5. Implemented in variations

### Anatomy of a Request/Response:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Headers
<CRLF>
BODY
```

A request structure is defined by both client and server, the request has a boundary, response & request defined by a protocol and message format.

### How to build an upload image service with a request-response

1. Send larger request with the image (simple)
2. Chunk image and send a request per chunk (resumable)

### When request-response is not work

1. Notifiacation sevice
2. Chatting application
3. Very Long Requests
4. What if client disconects?

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous

#### Synchrounous

Operations are those where the caller sends a request and waits for the response. The caller is blocked during this time and cannot proceed with other tasks until the response is received. This is like making a phone call and waiting on the line for the other person to pick up. Behaviour of synchronous I/O:

1. Caller sends a request and blocks
2. Caller cannot execute any code meanwhile
3. Receiver responds, caller unblocks
4. Caller and Receiver are in "sync"

**Example of an OS synchronous I/O:**

1. Program asks OS to read from disk
2. Program main thread is taken off of the
3. Read completes, program can resume excution
4. Example of code :
   ```Javascript
        doWork();
        readFile("largefile.dat");
        doWork2();
   ```

#### Asynchronous

Operations, on the other hand, allow the caller to send a request and then proceed with other tasks without waiting for the response. When the response is ready, it is handled by a callback function or a promise. This is like sending an email and then going about your day, checking for a response later. Behaviour of asyncgronous I/O:

1. Caller sends a request
2. Caller can work until it gets a response
3. Caller either:
   - check if the response is ready (epoll)
   - Reciver calls back when it'done (io_uring)
   - Spins up a new thread that blocks
4. Caller and receiver are not necessary in async  
   **Example of an OS asynchronous call (Node JS)**
5. Program spins up a secondary thread
6. Secondary thread reads from disk, OS blocks it
7. Main Program still running and executing code
8. Thread finish reading and calls back main thread
9. Example of code:

```Javascript
    doWork();
    readFile("largefile.dat", onReadFinished(theFile));
    doWork2();
```

**Asynchronous workload is everywhere**

1. Asynchronous Programming (promise/futures)
2. Asynchronous backend Processing
3. Asynchronous commits in postgres
4. Asynchronous IO in Linux (epool, io_uring)
5. Asynchronous replication
6. Asynchronous OS fsync (fs cache)

### Design Pattern Execution/Real-Time Comunication Between a client and a server in Backend

#### I. Push

This is a general term for techniques where the server sends updates to the client without waiting for a request(Client connects to a server, Server sends data to the client, Client doesn't have to request anything, Protocol must be bidirectional, Used by RabbitMQ). SSE and WebSockets are examples of push techniques.

**When we use this(Request/response isn't always ideal)**

1. Client wants real time notification from backend
   - A user just logged in
   - A message is just received
2. Push model is good for certain cases

**Push Pros and Cons**

1. Pros:
   - Real time
2. Cons :
   - Client must be online
   - Client might not be able to handle
   - Requires a bidirectional protocol
   - Polling is prefered for light clients

#### II. Short Polling

Short Polling, often simply referred to as Polling, is a method used for real-time communication between the client (usually a web browser) and the server (Request is taking a while, I'll check you later) or (Client sends a request, Server responds immediately with a handle, Server continues to process the request, Client uses that handle to check for status, and Multiplt "short" request response as polls).

**When we use this(Request/response isn't always ideal)**

1. A request takes long time to process
   - Upload a youtube video
2. The backend want tot sends notification
   - A user just logged in
3. Polling is a good communication style

**Short polling Pros and Cons**

1. Pros
   - Simple
   - Good for long running requests
   - Client can disconnect
2. Cons
   - Too chatty
   - Network bandwidth
   - Wasted Backend resources

#### III. Long Polling

Long Polling is a variation of the traditional polling technique and allows emulating a push mechanism under circumstances where a real push is not possible (Request is taking long, I'll check with you later But talk to me only when it's ready or server will keep request than when ready will back it) or (Client sends a request, Server responds immediately with a handle, Server continues to p, Client uses that handle to chechk for status, Server DOES not reply until it has the response, and So we got a handle we can disconnect & we are less chatty, and Some variation has timeouts too).

**When we use this(Request/response & polling isn't always ideal)**

1. A request takes long time to proccess
   - Upload a youtube video
2. The backend want to sends notification
   - A user just logged in
3. Short Polling is a good but chatty
4. Meet Long Polling (Kafka uses it)

**Long Polling Pros and Cons**

1. Pros
   - Less chatty and backend freiendly
   - Client can still disconnect
2. Cons
   - Not real time

### IV. Server Sent Event

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a standard that allows a web server to push updates to the client whenever it wants to, without the client needing to send a request each time. It's a one-way communication channel from the server to the client (One Request, a very very long reponse without end) or (A response has start & end, client sends a request, server sends logic events asa part of response, server never writes the end of teh response, it is still a request but an unending response, client parses the streams data lookingfor this event, and works with request/response (HTTP)).

**When we use this(limitations of Request/response)**

1. Vanilla Request/response isn't ideal for notification backend
2. Client wants real time notification from backend
   - A user just logged in
   - A message is just received
3. Push works but restrictive
4. Server-Sent Events work with Request/response

**SSE Pros and Cons**

1. Pros
   - Real time
   - Compatible with Request/reponse
2. Cons
   - Client must be online
   - Client might not be able to handle
   - Pollingis preferred for light clients
   - HTTP/1.1 problem (6 commections)

### V. Publish Subscribe

The Publish-Subscribe pattern, often referred to as Pub/Sub, is a messaging pattern used in distributed systems, where senders (publishers) of messages are not programmed to send their messages to specific receivers (subscribers) (One publisher sned to many readers)

**When we use this**

1. Upload video
   - Client sent to some upload server then continue to some servers (compress Format and notification)
   - Then upload server send back to client

**Publish Subscribe Pros and Cons**

1. Pros
   - Scales w/ multiple receivers
   - Great for microservices
   - Loose Coupling
   - Works while clients not running
2. Cons
   - Message delivery issues (Two genrals problem)
   - Complexity
   - Network Saturation

### V. Multiplexing & Demultiplexing & Connection Pooling

1.  Multiplexing
    Multiplexing (often abbreviated as muxing) is the process of combining multiple signals or data streams into one signal over a shared medium. The aim is to share an expensive resource. For example, in telecommunications, multiple telephone calls may be transferred using one wire.  
    **Example:** 3 connections in HTTP/1.1 -> be 1 connection in HTTP/2

2.  Demultiplexing
    Demultiplexing (demuxing) is the reverse process of multiplexing. It involves taking a single input signal that carries multiple combined signals and separating it back into the original individual signals at the receiver's end. This is essential for correctly routing each signal to its intended recipient.  
    **Example:** 1 concection in HTTP/2 -> be 3 connections in HTTP/1.1

3.  Connection Pooling
    Connection Pooling is a technique used in various types of computing environments to manage a pool of connections that can be reused when future requests to a database or a network service are required. This approach is commonly used in applications that interact with databases or remote services to optimize performance and resource utilization.  
    **Example:** 3 connections in client -> backend server continue 3 connections -> database server

### VI. Stateful vs Stateless backend

1. Stateful
   A stateful system maintains session state across multiple requests. This means that the system remembers previous interactions and can use this information to manage current and future interactions. In a stateful architecture, the state of the application is stored either on the server, client, or a distributed cache. (Store state about clients in its memory, Depends on the information being there)  
   **Example**

2. Stateless
   A stateless system does not keep any internal state between requests. Each request is processed independently without any knowledge of past interactions. This means that each request must contain all the information necessary for processing. (Client is responsible to "transfer the state" with every request, May store but can safely lose it)  
   **What makes a backend stateless?**
   - Stateless backend can store state somewhere else (database)
   - The backend remain stateless but the system is stateful
