# Backend Communication Design Patterns
## Request - Response 
This is classic, simple, and everywhere. 

### What happens in the Request Response Model
1. `Client sends a Request`
2. `Server parses the Request`
3. `Server processes the Request`
4. `Server sends a Response`
5. `Client parses the Response and consumes`

### Where this is used in:
1. Web, HTTP, DNS, SSH
2. RPC (remote procedure call)
3. SQL and Database Protocols
4. APIs (REST/SOP/GraphQL)
5. Implemented in variations

### Anatomy of a Request/Response:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Headers
<CRLF>
BODY
```
A request structure is defined by both client and server, the request has a boundary, response & request defined by a protocol and message format.
